# Attribution notice

NordConverter was originally based on **NordVPN-Wireguard**, created by Stefano
Fiorini:

https://github.com/sfiorini/NordVPN-Wireguard

The original project provided the core approach of temporarily connecting with
the NordVPN Linux client, reading parameters from the active NordLynx interface,
and writing those parameters as a WireGuard configuration.

NordConverter has since been substantially modified. Changes include:

- an interactive destination menu;
- automatic login-state detection;
- browser, callback-link, and access-token login flows;
- preserved and safely quoted command-line arguments;
- dependency and input validation;
- automatic cleanup following most errors;
- restrictive permissions for generated configurations;
- updated WireGuard configuration syntax; and
- rewritten installation and usage documentation.
